\section{Introduction}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the context of complex decision-making tasks.
However, the depoyment of RL agents in real-world applications still have several challenges.
One of the main challenges is that we cannot ensure the safety of RL agents.
This is largely due to the presence of scenarios that were not encountered during training, as well as differences between the training and deployment environments.
To address this issue, many approaches have been proposed to ensure the safety of RL agents.
In this document, we focus on the Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework.
